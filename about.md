I'm Simon-Pierre Gingras, a software developer for [Poka](https://poka.io). I currently moved out of Qu√©bec to British Columbia for the adventures.
I like simple things that work. Outside of coding, I love alpine skiing, mountain biking, chocolate and ultimate frisbee.

You can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/spgingras), [Github](https://github.com/spg) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-pierre-gingras-681a4b20).
